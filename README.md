# NASA Solar Wind Health Alert System

## Overview
A predictive alert system for geomagnetic disturbances using NASA solar wind data. Designed for individuals sensitive to solar activity, including heart patients.

## Features
- Real-time ingestion of NASA solar wind datasets
- Visualization of plasma flows around Earth
- Predictive alert system for sensitive users
- This prototype visualizes solar wind events and provides predictive alerts for sensitive users, demonstrating the application of scientific computing skills.


## Tech Stack
Python | numpy | pandas | matplotlib | Flask/Kivy | NASA API

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py` to start the alert system

## Status
Prototype successfully demonstrated at "33rd International Cosmic Olympiad" and won the competition.
Currently available as documentation and visualizations; the code can be restored for full functionality if required.
